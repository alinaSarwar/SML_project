This repo contains the code for our Supervised Machine Learning course project called Facify, which is a facial attributes classifier for the  [UTK faces dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/). The CNN folder contains all the training and testing code files used for **Multi-Label Image Classification with Pytorch** (reference: [**Multi-Label Image Classification with Pytorch**](https://www.learnopencv.com/multi-label-image-classification-with-pytorch/)) whereas the **traditional ML methods** are implemented in the folder named Traditional.
